<b>Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?</b>
The company was Artemis Financial, and they wanted to update the security of their online API.

<b>What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? 
What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?</b>
I did well to recognize the security vulnerabilities from reading about the company and its tasks. It is important to code securely, or else malicious people could infiltrate and steal information. Having security helps a company become trustworthy and, therefore, more successful. 

<b>Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?</b>
It was challenging to look over the code to find bad code or insecure code as i was unsure of what i was looking for. 

<b>How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?</b>
I increased security by having numerous checks in place to look for outdated software and implemented an HTTPS protocol on the file. 

<b>How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?</b>
I checked over the vulnerability report that we had put in to check for those things. I made sure to constantly run the code after each addition to ensure that the code was still running fine.

<b>What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?</b>
Utilizing the vulnerability report to check on the code was very helpful and will keep this in mind when doing my own work in java as it is also super easy to implement. 

<b>What might you show future employers from this assignment?</b>
I would show the report that was generated, what each of the codes means, and how to fix them. There is a website where you can look up the actual discrepancy and decide how you wish to proceed with the vulnerability.
